# Godot-Nexus (WIP)
A git submodule to add networking capabilities to games made in godot, supports TCP and Websocket transports. 
Websocket transport must be used in conjunction with project [gonexus](https://github.com/krshock/gonexus)(A Golang Websocket Server) to provide play room sessions to share with friends on the internet

## This is not a Godot extension
This project must be added as a git submodule to add networking camabilities, including TCP and Websocket transport layers
